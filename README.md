Hello, I hope you are well and great
The code was implemented at the request of Code Challenge
Both APIs are implemented and are requested simultaneously
And also the answers are returned in a structure

It was implemented as far as the APIs provided free keys for free
In the second provider, unfortunately, I could not change the base and it had limitations in the free version
It was possible and implemented in the Ù‘First Provider (Coinmarketcap)


Please test it by running it as the initial value, and if requested, change it and put another value.
