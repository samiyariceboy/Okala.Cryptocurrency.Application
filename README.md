Hello, I hope you are well and great
The code was implemented at the request of Code Challenge
Both APIs are implemented and are requested simultaneously
And also the answers are returned in a structure

It was implemented as far as the APIs provided free keys for free
In the second provider, unfortunately, I could not change the base and it had limitations in the free version
It was possible and implemented in the Ù‘First Provider (Coinmarketcap)


Please test it by running it as the initial value, and if requested, change it and put another value.

#
1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment? What would you add to
your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding
assignment then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

If I had more extra time 
I was working on the dynamic part of implementing the best price formula for each currency per all suppliers 
In addition to that, the implementation of an alarm if the price of the desired currency reaches the desired price

#
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
language of choice? 

Implementation of returning a proper output in different providers with unordered json format

#
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
had to do this?

Using a combination of multiple tools 
including database profiles, execution plans 
Also use http profiler like charles tool 

Software testing including unit tests, split test, performance test, stress test, benchmark test, etc.

#
4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you
have been to? What did you
learn?

Macroservice book in .NET 
DDD book by Eric Evans 
and related articles in the field of distributed systems

#
5. What do you think about this technical assessment?

In my opinion, the question could not measure the science of object orientation, it could also add more complexities of business logic that test quality and 
Appropriate design patterns were used in it

6. Please, describe yourself using JSON.
